                  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Lets get started</h3>
                  <p style="font-style: initial;font-size: 1.25rem;text-align: center;">It was really an awesome day in my life after getting done with my high school examinations finally we planned a trip to kerala cool rite!!! but don't get suprised after all it's a medical duty for my mother,She was assigned as an examiner to a medical college in alleppey.But it felt ok for me to spend sometime in the house of nature and backwaters.But the reality was quite different .First of all we managed to book train tickets at the 11th hour haha!!!,but i am the one in my family who eagerly waits to book travel tickets first i don't know why but it was something that makes me Happy.It was the the day,We took a cab to the station and as always dad shouts at him haha!! how poor is that driver He got frigtened as we are the first costumers of the day.Mom packed everything including our lunch an dinner.i am a kind of person who falls for outside food not only me but you also nah!!!, But my Mom always yell's at me off course Mom's are always they are.While we are waiting at the platform something got my attention oh relax it's just the beauty of the winter morning scenes at railway station.It was cold and windy off course i forgot my jacket even after having a fight with mom at home.Finally,the train has arrived after 4 and half hours more than the schedule time, we can't do anything with the timings in indian railways.We boarded the train it was half filled and i was very excited to know my companion for the rest of the journey.It was a 70 year old person!!!!!!! all of a sudden all my energy went down.So i was praying that something should happen atlest in alleppey.It was quite long journey not quite but too long journey.Finally,lunch time , i was checking my instagram feed and mom called me,But she does'nt know that i had mutton biryani with side of kabab's which was brought to me by fathers assistant yes off course you guessed it rite!!!.The train was passing through the hometown(Ambur,TN) of dad in Tamil-nadu.I some how managed him to bring the items i had .It was the Best biryani i ever had and also the kababs i think you guys should also try the "THE AMBUR BIRYANI".After having lunch i plugged in my ear pods and made my self comfortble.Stations are passing by diiferent different languages,cultures,temples these train journies are most beautiful journies in the whole world that's why i think most of the authors prefer train scenarios.WOW!! how cool is the weather it was wonderful.After passing stations,it was around 8 in the evening,the train had a halt in a town i don't remember the name.There i saw a vendor who is selling "Bannana Chips" so i thought that we had entered Kerala.I jumped out the train and after having some gibrish talks with him i finally brought my chips.I was enjoying my chips and dad passed by he saw me holding that chips packet and said "you could have get these chips in kerala because,its the famous place ".how innocent i am!!!.It was 4 in the morning we arrived that the station .we arranged a cab to the hotel,never ever forget that train journey in my life......
